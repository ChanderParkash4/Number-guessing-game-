Imagine this: the computer is thinking of a secret number, and your job is to guess what it is.
It won’t tell you the number right away (because where’s the fun in that?).

1 The computer secretly picks a random number between 1 and 100.

2. You take a guess.

3. If your guess is too small, it says:
“Nope, too low — aim higher!”

4. If your guess is too big, it says:
“Whoa, too high — go lower!”

5. You keep guessing until you hit the jackpot and the computer says:
“🎉 Correct! You found the number!”

There’s no limit to how many times you can try, so it’s all about paying attention to the clues and narrowing down the answer.

This little project teaches you how to:

Make the computer “think” of a random number.

Keep asking the player for input until they get it right.

Give useful hints along the way.

It’s simple, quick to play, and surprisingly addictive — because once you start, you just have to find that number.
